# applescript-calendar-copy
Small script that allows to copy all events anonymized from one calendar to another one. I use this to publish my availability to customers without giving up all information. I know using Exchange would be easier but I like iCloud too much.

This is not a sync. So if you delete something from your normal calendar you should delete it from the other one as well.
