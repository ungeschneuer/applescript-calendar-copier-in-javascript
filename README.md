# Calendar Copier in Javascript for Apple Script
A Small script that allows to copy all events anonymized from one calendar to another one. I use this to publish my availability to customers without giving up all information. I know using Exchange would be easier but I like iCloud too much.

Script is in Javascript because AppleScript is a horrible language this seemde to be the only way to make it work though. 

This is not a sync, so if you delete something from your normal calendar you should delete it from the other one as well. 
The only option for a sync would be to delete everything from the target calendar and then rewrite it. Maybe I will implement this as well in the future.
